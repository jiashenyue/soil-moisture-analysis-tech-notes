# Tech Note 3: Downloading and Preparing VIIRS Vegetation Incides Data

Shenyue Jia \| 06/04/2024

## Overview

-   This tutorial focuses on how to download VIIRS data from NASA Earthdata Search and prepare them for future use
    -   We will use VIIRS Vegetation Indices (1km, 16-day, [VNP13A2 v002](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/vnp13a2v002/)) as an example
-   Some basic information about HDF (Hierarchical Data Format) data

## Search VNP13A2 data from NASA Earthdata Search

- Following [Access Data](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/vnp13a2v002/#tools) to find the download option from NASA Earthdata Search
  - Or you can visit [NASA Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search) and use **VNP13A2** as data collection name for searching

- Click the green **+** sign to add the first dataset to your search
  - VIIRS/NPP Vegetation Indices 16-Day L3 Global 1km SIN Grid V002
- We can apply conditions such as dates and geographical area of interest to further narrow down the data for download
  - In this example, we will use the year of 2015 as an example (01/01/2015-12/31/2015)
  - We can also try uploading a Shapefile (or other formats) of California as our area of interest to further narrow down the search results
    - If using a Shapefile, make sure you find all files that consist of a Shapefile

    - Select all these files and compress them to a `.zip` file

![img]()

    - Upload this zip file

    - Click the boundary of California after uploading the zip file to activate this area of interest
    - Sometimes we may see a notification indicating the file we upload contains too many points and has been simplified

    - Now we find the total number of available granules is much smaller than before

## VIIRS data download

- We can now click the green **Download** button to find options for download
- We will use a download script `.sh` rather than the direct links for download
  - Download the script generated by NASA Earthdata
  
![img]()  
  
- Refer to [this tutorial] on how to correctly run this script in Windows 11
  - Several key steps mentioned in the[tutorial]
    - Navigate to the correct folder to save data
    - If running the script using Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL), make sure to run a Windows PowerShell command to convert the file directories in the download script to Unix style
    - Run the shell script (`.sh`) in WSL
